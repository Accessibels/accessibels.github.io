# Hey, you. You're finally awake.

*"You were trying to study audio and accessibility, right? Walked right into that 'game developer' ambush, same as us, and that researcher over there."* 

*"Damn you, dipshit corporate overlords. Accessibility was awesome until you came along. A11ys were nice and proactive. If they hadn't been combating your tweets and poor business decisions, they could've designed that game and be halfway to 100% accessible. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these profits the overlords want. We're all brothers and sisters in accessibility now, a11y."*

## Humble beginnings

My name is Luke, I'm a PhD student researching audio accessibility for games. If you couldn't tell from the introductionary prose, I enjoyed Skyrim [1] a lot. *What an iconic introduction, right?*

One of my favourite things from that game was the Clairvoyance spell; a wonderful spell that, in a game vast and as diverse as Skyrim, helped my foggy ND brain find its way around in lieu of strong navigational skills. Success!

But I'm a sound designer. Sound, audio and music are my *ahem* jam. And this little navigational tool in Skyrim might be awesome, but ultimately... it's silent. My years of audio training are booing condesendingly from the back of the room.

And the annoying part is, all that information is *there* (be it a nav mesh, some wayfinding algorhithm or whatevs). Why not sonify it? Get a cheeky bit of spatial sound or audio marking or summin summin alongside that ghostly directional mist.

14 year old me on was hooked on this idea. Between wanting to mod reverberation into Minecraft [2] and play in metal bands, I was hooked. Let's make cool sound in games. 

So I do a degree, and it's awesome. I learn to code games and make tunes and all that jazz and then I think about doing a Masters. This term 'accessibility' keeps showing up... 14 year old me is now 21 year old me. All this time, me adjusting setting in my games to benefit the way I want to play them now has a name. 

"Shit!" I exclaim. "*THIS* is what its called".

## An a11y's last thoughts should be of games. Accessibels. I'm... I'm from Accessibels

(more quotes from accessible Ralof and Lokir from the future... promise)

While it's primary objective is to evidence my innate pun-menteau ability, Accessibels' super secret ACTUAL primary objective is to muse over making games accessible with audio and make this information available to everyone as a method of sparking accessibility conversations and helping folks figure out accessibility in their own gaming much earlier than I did. 

*I'm not sure how this is going to look in the future, but for now, expect musings from my PhD research, comments, resources and beyond.

*"Why are we stopping?"*

*"Why do you think? START of the a11y line."*

*"Let's go. Shouldn't keep the devs waiting for us."*
